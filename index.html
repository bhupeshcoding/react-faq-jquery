      <h3>What is React?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces,
          particularly for single-page applications. It allows you to create
          reusable UI components and efficiently update them when data changes
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>What is JSX?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It's a syntax extension that allows you
          to write HTML-like structures within your JavaScript code. This makes
          it easier to visualize the UI you're building.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>What is the Virtual DOM?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          The Virtual DOM is a lightweight in-memory representation of the
          actual DOM. When data changes in your React application, React first
          updates the Virtual DOM, then compares it to the actual DOM, and only
          updates the parts of the actual DOM that have changed. This makes
          updates more efficient.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>What are components?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Components are the building blocks of React applications. They are
          reusable pieces of code that encapsulate a specific part of the UI.
          Components can be simple or complex, and they can be composed together
          to create more complex UIs.    
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>What are props?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Props are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child
          component. They are read-only and cannot be modified by the child
          component.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>What is state?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          State is a way to store data that is internal to a component. When the
          state changes, the component re-renders.  
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>What are React Hooks?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle
          features from functional components. They were introduced in React
          16.8 and provide a more concise and functional way to manage state and
          side effects.        
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>What is Context API?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          The Context API is a way to share data between components without
          having to pass props down through the entire component tree.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>What are Higher-Order Components (HOCs)?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component
          with added functionality. They are a powerful way to reuse component
          logic.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>What is React Router?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          React Router is a library that allows you to handle navigation and
          routing in your React application. It enables you to create
          single-page applications with multiple views.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>What is server-side rendering (SSR)?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          SSR is a technique for rendering React components on the server and
          sending the pre-rendered HTML to the client. This can improve initial
          load time and SEO. C

              Focus on UI: React is primarily a UI library and may require
              additional libraries for routing, state management, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Explain the difference between props and state. Props are
              read-only data passed from parent to child, while state is
              internal data managed within a component.

        <h3>How do you handle forms in React?</h3>
        <div class="p-0 m-0">
          <p>
            React provides controlled components, where form data is handled in
            the component's state, and uncontrolled components, where form data
            is handled by the DOM.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>What are the different lifecycle methods in React?</h3>
        <div class="p-0 m-0">
          <p>
            Lifecycle methods are special methods that get called during
            different phases of a component's life, such as mounting, updating,
            and unmounting. (Note: With the introduction of Hooks, some
            lifecycle methods are less relevant, but understanding the component
            lifecycle is still important.)
